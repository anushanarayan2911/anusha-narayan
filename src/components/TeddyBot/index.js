              <Text>Mathematics is often considered to be the most boring subject 
                for young children. The lack of interactivity means that they are 
                frequently disengaged and do not enjoy the essential subject.

              TeddyBot is a robotic game that will help children to practice their 
              addition and subtraction skills.

              Technological development of the patch can be categorised into 4 groups: MEMS, 
              materials, wearable technology and machine learning. 4 types of MEMS sensors were 
              used to collect data: acoustic, resistive, EKG and PPG. These would all monitor 
              different aspects of lung health.

                The app will be paired with each userâ€™s Pulmo. It will keep the user 
                informed on their lung status, capitalising on the trend of self-monitoring 
                health. It will also help to ensure proper usage of the device, and reminds 
                the user to keep it well-maintained. In the event that inconsistencies are 
                detected, the app will generate a preliminary diagnosis that the user can 
                then share with their doctor, who can then validate it.

                As home IOT systems become more common, Pulmo will integrate fully with other 
                smart devices in the home. By connecting with other devices linked to air quality, 
                the air that the user breathes in will be optimised, improving the user's lung 
                health, and subsequently, quality of life.
